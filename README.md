# Learning_in_the_brain

## Guiding questions: 
1. What type of learning processes occur in the brain and can they all be characterised as 'optimisation'?
2. Can all learning processes be classified as either equilibrium or non-equilibrium processes? 
3. What is the potential role and limitation of gradient-based backpropagation in the human brain? 
4. Are there important theoretical connections between optimisation(i.e. exploitation of knowledge) and sampling(i.e. exploration of known unknowns)?(Note: It's possible to infer the existence of unknown unknowns by sampling and probabilistic inference.) 
5. Is any sufficiently complex optimisation problem(ie which there's no hope to actually optimise) indistinguishable from a nonequilibrium process?(source: Martino Sorbaro // Twitter: @martopix)

(feel free to suggest other motivating questions)
